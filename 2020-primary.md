People asked me for my ballot, here you go:
- **President:** Warren, don't @ me.
- **DCCC:** Ugh.  This is not a good way to run a democratic process.  I will vote for any candidate who promises to fix it.  (I seem to recall actually seing somebody proposing to change it to Supervisor districts, but I can't find who.)  More seriously, I think I will probably just follow [The Leauge of Pissed-Off Voters](http://www.theleaguesf.org/#DCCC17) on this (which I think is identical to some other progressive slates I saw), but I don't claimed to be very informed here.
- **US House:** Nancy, even though it's the primary we are screwed without her and there will be no jinxing here.
- **State Senate:** Probably Wiener?  I don't love him on all things but I think he's good at what he does.  Jackie Fielder seems reasonable though, I could see voting for her in the primary.
- **State Assembly:** Chiu: is unopposed and fine/good.
- **Judges:** Evangelista, Tong, Gold; they seem to be the defense attorneys, the progressives, and endorsed by anybody progressive, so if those all line up let's go.
- **Prop 13:** (what a name) Yes: haven't seen anything against it and we like education bonds.
- **Prop A:** Mission Local's [article](https://missionlocal.org/2020/02/city-colleges-massive-bond-will-all-but-certainly-pass-and-not-everyone-is-thrilled/) is interesting, but it doesn't seem like no really solves anything, and, again, we like education bonds.
- **Prop B:** Yes: again, haven't seen anything against it and we like education bonds.
- **Prop C:** Yes: what a world we live in that this is on the ballot but it seems obviously good.
- **Prop D:** Yes: I haven't thought a lot about whether it's a Good Idea but if both SF YIMBY and SF Tenants Union are for it, it seems like it has to be.
- **Prop E:** Ugh, what a mess.  I'm still undecided on this one, and may still be on Tuesday morning.  It seems unlikely that there's a significant gain in affordable housing from this: the offset that would be needed per building is pretty big (if my math is right, to build say the Stripe office you would need 242 units to get in the fast-track and 715 units to actually get enough cap long-term, vs. 712 units/year we're building now).  Meanwhile, if there's no new affordable housing, the likely yearly loss is apparently $11M in taxes and $39M in affordable housing fees (see [slide 12](https://sfcontroller.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Economic%20Analysis/balanced_development_economic_impact_final.pdf)), which is not trivial but not huge.  So that leaves the likely effect of reducing large office construction: is more large office space without affordable housing not-ideal or actively bad?  I tend to lead towards not-ideal: while this doesn't apply directly to smaller spaces it can only add market pressure for small businesses and nonprofits and such.  Plus, this can't be modified by the supervisors, which is always bad.  So I'm leaning no, but I sure can't say I'm happy about it.
