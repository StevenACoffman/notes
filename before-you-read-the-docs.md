# Before you read the documentation

- first, think about what it *should* do!
- based on goals/philosophy, implementations, structural limitations
- helps make it easier to find things in the docs, and also good for improving your understanding of this thing and similar things
- example: go reflection (link to that post) -- key philosophy is just that `Type` represents a type, `Value` represents a value, and with few exceptions you can do exactly what you can in ordinary Go, no more and no less.
